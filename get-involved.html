                <p>
                  Are you interested in working in a museum? Do you enjoy the
                  fun and excitement of sharing the wonders of nature with
                  people? Well you could be just the right person to enjoy an
                  internship at the museum. You’ll be learning from a number of
                  different academics and people who are passionate about
                  science and sharing it with the wider community.

                <h2>Volunteer</h2>
                <p>
                  A number of people volunteer their time and effort to keep the
                  displays in good order and ready for visitors to come and
                  enjoy. Volunteering has its perks including getting to see
                  behind the scenes of a working museum, access to staff-only
                  lectures, and a monthly lunch where all staff and volunteers
                  come together to discuss ideas for future exhibits and
                  strategies for the museum.
